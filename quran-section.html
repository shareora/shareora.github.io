  <h2>Bismillah 🌸</h2>
  <p>Welcome, dear soul.</p>

  <p>This section is dedicated to learning and reflecting on the most beautiful and complete guide — the <strong>Al-Qur’an</strong>.</p>

  <p>Whether you're reading it for the first time or returning to it with a new heart, know that every step you take toward the Qur’an is a step toward light, healing, and closeness to Allah.</p>

  <p>You don’t have to know everything. You don’t have to be perfect. You just need to begin — with sincerity.</p>

  <p><em>Let’s walk this journey together, slowly and meaningfully, insyaAllah.</em></p>

  <h2>A New Approach to Memorising the Qur'an</h2>
  <p>Many of us — believe it or not — are trying hard to memorise the Qur'an. But along the way, I realised that many of us might have gotten it wrong from the very start.</p>

  <p>We focus so much on memorisation without truly understanding the meaning behind the words. The truth is, memorising without understanding doesn't truly connect us to the message of the Qur'an — the guidance, wisdom, and mercy that it carries for all of us.</p>

  <p>That's when I decided: before I can fully memorise the Qur'an, I need to understand it — word by word.</p>

  <p>So I began learning Arabic. But soon, I realised that traditional Arabic lessons often focus on conversational Arabic — how to speak, how to order food, how to greet someone. That might be helpful in other contexts, but in Singapore, it's rare for anyone to hold conversations in Arabic. So for me, it wasn't the right focus.</p>

  <h3>Instead, I'm now taking a different path:</h3>
  <p>I'm working to learn the meaning of every word in the Qur'an — slowly, thoughtfully — and memorising the Qur’an with full understanding.</p>

  <p>It's not the fastest way, but I believe it's the most meaningful. Because this way, every ayah I memorise isn't just stored in my mind, but also in my heart.</p>

  <p>So without further delay, I'm beginning this journey with reciting Surah Al-Fatihah — the perfect starting point.</p>
